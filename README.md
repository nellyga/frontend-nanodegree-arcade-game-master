How to play this Game:

The Goal is simple:

In order to play use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move hero character
left, right, up or down(to move across the gray bricks towards the water).

Avoid the enemy "bugs". If one hits you you will be notified by the following, "BAM" and
sent to the start again.

If you reach the other side you win and you are sent to the start
for another attempt.
The "Score" count will show how many times you made it across.
Score increases by one point for each time you make it across.
